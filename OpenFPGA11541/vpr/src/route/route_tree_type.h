 * u.next:  Used only when this node is on the free list.  Gives the next    *

 * C_downstream:  Total downstream capacitance from this rt_node.  That is,  *
 *                the total C of the subtree rooted at the current node,     *
 *                including the C of the current node.                       *
 * R_upstream:  Total upstream resistance from this rt_node to the net       *
 *              source, including any device_ctx.rr_nodes[].R of this node.  *
 * Tdel:  Time delay for the signal to get from the net source to this node. *
