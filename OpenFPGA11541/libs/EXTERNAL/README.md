This folder contains libraries developed outside of the VTR repository.

Some are simply checked in manually (e.g. libpugixml), while others are kept in sync using the 'git subtree' command (see README.developers.md in the repository root for usage).

These libraries should NOT BE MODIFIED since they would diverge from their mainline versions, making it difficult to update in the future.
